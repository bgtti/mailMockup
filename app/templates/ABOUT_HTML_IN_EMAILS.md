# HTML and CSS in emails

HTML support in email clients is not the same as in web browsers.
Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, Zoho, Apple Mail, Thunderbird → all use different rendering engines, and Outlook is by far the most restrictive because it uses Microsoft Word to render HTML.

## HTML tags that are safe to use in emails

Below is the reliable, industry-accepted list of HTML elements and CSS rules that are accepted safely across major email clients.

✅ Basic structure:
```
<html>
<head> (limited support)
<body>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
```

✅ Text, headers, and link content
```
<p>
<span>
<b>, <strong>
<i>, <em>
<u>
<br>
<hr>
<small>
<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>
<a>
```

✅ Lists
```
<ul>
<ol>
<li>
```

✅ Images
```
<img>
```

Obs about igames:
- Must have width, height, alt attributes
- Should NOT rely on CSS for sizing
- Should NOT rely on external fonts inside SVG images

✅ Divs
```
<div>
```

Obs about divs:
- Supported, but limited CSS support in Outlook.
- Use `<table>` for layout instead of `<div>`.

✅ Styling/formatting
```
<font>  (deprecated on web but widely used in email)
<blockquote>
<code>
<pre> (monospace formatting not always reliable)
```

✅ Tables (the core of all HTML emails)
```
<table>
<thead>
<tbody>
<tfoot>
<tr>
<td>
<th>
```

Obs about tables:
- Tables behave consistently across all email clients → use them whenever possible!

## HTML tags that should be avoided in emails

The tags bellow are not supported in many major email clients:

❌ Layout & advanced HTML
```
<section>
<article>
<header>
<footer>
<aside>
<main>
<canvas>
<video>, <audio>
<svg> (partially supported, but Outlook breaks it)
<iframe>
<object>, <embed>
<form>, <input>, <button>, <select>
<nav> (use <table> structure instead for nav-like blocks)
<title> (stripped and ignored by Gmail, Outlook and others)
<meta> (mostly stripped and ignored, with the exception of <meta charset="UTF-8"> --> without it some may assume Windows-1252 encoding. pple Mail supports some CSS-related meta tags, like: <meta name="x-apple-disable-message-reformatting"> --> This prevents Apple Mail from “smart formatting” emails.)
```

Obs about meta tag:
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">` should be used, without it some email providers may assume Windows-1252 encoding. 
- Apple Mail supports some CSS-related meta tags, like: `<meta name="x-apple-disable-message-reformatting">` --> This prevents Apple Mail from “smart formatting” emails.

❌ Scripts & dynamic content
```
<script>  (blocked everywhere)
<link rel="stylesheet">
<style>   (only partially supported; Gmail strips some) 
```

Obs about style:
- Inline CSS is required because most email clients strip external CSS. 
- Use it only for non-critical enhancements, do not rely for important visual layouts. Some clients use them, though: Apple Mail, iOS Mail, Outlook.com, Gmail web, Yahoo.
- You can use styles for tag resets (body, table, etc), basic elements settings like: `img { border:0; }`, `table { border-collapse: collapse; }`, Apple-specific meta and styles `a[x-apple-data-detectors] { color: inherit; }`, Mobile responsive styles (media queries) for most part (Gmail, Yahoo, Apple Mail, iOS Mail — but ignored by Outlook desktop )

Try not put the bellow in style block - these are either stripped, ignored, or break in Outlook:
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- position: absolute
- display: flex
- `:root`
- Custom fonts via `@font-face`
- Complex selectors (`.header > p > span`, attribute selectors)
- CSS variables

## CSS in emails

CSS support is very limited.

To build reliable emails:
- Use inline styles
- Avoid Flexbox
- Avoid Grid
- Avoid floating layouts
- Avoid background images (Outlook does not support them unless via VML)

Safe CSS properties include:
```
color
font-family
font-size
line-height
text-align
padding
margin (except margin on <p> sometimes removed)
background-color
border, border-radius (border-radius not supported everywhere but okay)
display: block (safe)
width, height
max-width (supported by Gmail/Apple Mail but not Outlook desktop)
```
