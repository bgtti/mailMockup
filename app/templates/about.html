      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>
        Choose an email template, pick an email type (like “Welcome email” or “Password reset”),
        and instantly see how they look together.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also send a test email to any address to preview the final design in your inbox.

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        This tool helps companies design and improve their automated emails.
      </p>
      <p>
        Automated system emails are often inconsistent and hard to visualize. MailMockup solves this by letting users
        preview each email type with different templates, ensuring a unified brand look.
      </p>
      <p>
        Test emails can be sent to any address so teams can check real-life rendering before going live.
      </p>
      <p class="about-highlight">
        No more guessing what your automated emails will look like.

    <h3>For developers & product teams</h3>
    <p>
      Developers can modify and create templates at their customer’s request.
      Before implementation in the software, customers can check and test different templates and approve both design
      and text.
    </p>
    <p>
      This simplifies communication between developers and customers by making requirements clearer
      and facilitating approval through visual previews instead of long email threads.
